# alx-Maze-Project
This is the Research & Project approval (Part 1) project in the ALX Software Engineering program under project portfolio.

# **Maze project**

## Main Context

The aim of this project is to create a game in 3D using raycasting !

## Tasks

0. Walls !

    In this first part, you’ll have to:
    * Create a window with SDL2
    * Use [raycasting](https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-table-of-contents/) to draw walls on your window !
    * You don’t need to be able to rotate the camera during the execution in this part, but you must provide a way to change the angle of the camera in your code to see if it works after recompiling it
    * The color of the walls must be different from the color of the ground/ceil
    * The map doesn’t need to be parsed from a file, but you must provide a way to modify it in your code to see if it works after recompiling it. (e.g. using an array of arrays of integers or characters)
